Ingredients

    3/4 cup vegan margarine (or butter substitute)
    1/3 cup white sugar
    3/4 cup brown sugar
    1 teaspoon vanilla
    1/2 cup soy milk (or other non-dairy milk substitute)
    1 cup all-purpose flour
    1/2 teaspoon baking soda
    1/2 teaspoon cinnamon

Steps to Make It

    Gather the ingredients.

    Pre-heat the oven to 350 F. You don't need to grease a cookie sheet for this recipe. 

    In a large bowl, cream together the vegan margarine with the white sugar and brown sugar until smooth and creamy.

    Add the vanilla and soy milk (or other non-dairy milk substitute) and mix well until well combined.

    Add the flour, baking soda, cinnamon, ginger powder, ground cloves, and nutmeg, and stir again until well mixed.

    Then stir in the quick cooking oats and the cranberries.

    Spoon the dough in 1 1/2-inch balls onto an un-greased cookie sheet and bake 10 to 15 minutes, or until done.

    Allow to cool on a rack.

    Serve and enjoy!
